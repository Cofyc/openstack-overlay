This overlay is here to run Nova / Openstack on our Gentoo Image

You'll notice there are some ebuild in there which are revision bumped versions of whats already present in the main gentoo portage tree. 
Typically these ebuild have been modified to exclude building for python 3.*, since they require setuptools, which is not available for python 3.*.

Using this overlay through layman:
----------------------------------
- "emerge layman"
- Edit the layman configuration "vi /etc/layman/layman.cfg" and add 
  https://github.com/hyves-org/openstack-overlay/blob/master/openstack-overlay.xml 
  to the 'overlay:' section.
- Now run "layman -a openstack" to add the overlay
